# Graphs

This project was implemented to learn graphs algorithms.
It was written in python and in typescript.

Beware that the two parts, python and typescript are separated,
the python part is not the backend of the frontend part.

In python you have:
- general algorithms on graphs
- general algorithms on heap
- some other algorithms

In typescript:
- a small component designed to use a Trie
